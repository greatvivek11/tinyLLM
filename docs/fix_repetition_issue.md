# 1. The Critical Flaw: Incorrect Training Objective
The single biggest issue is in your model.py's forward function. The model is not being trained to predict the next token; it's being trained to predict the current token, which it has just been given.

## The Problem:

In your TinyLLM.forward method:

```Python
# model.py

    def forward(self, idx, targets=None):
         # ...
        logits = self.lm_head(x) # (B, T, VOCAB_SIZE)

        loss = None
        if targets is not None:
            B, T, C = logits.shape
            logits = logits.view(B * T, C)
            targets = targets.view(B * T)
            loss = F.cross_entropy(logits, targets) # <-- PROBLEM HERE

        return logits, loss
```
You are taking the entire logits tensor (of shape [Batch, Time, Vocab_Size]) and the entire targets tensor and comparing them directly.

Let's trace the data:

get_dynamic_batch creates xb (e.g., tokens [0...127]) and yb (tokens [1...128]). This is correct. yb are the targets for xb.

The model's forward pass takes xb as idx.

The model produces logits. The logit at logits[:, t, :] is the model's prediction for the next token, given the input sequence idx[:, 0:t].

Therefore, logits[:, t, :] should be compared against targets[:, t], which corresponds to idx[:, t+1].

Your current code, however, compares logits.view(B*T, C) with targets.view(B*T). This means you are implicitly asking the model: "given input idx[t], what is the output for target[t]?". Since your targets are just idx shifted by one, this doesn't align correctly and confuses the model's objective.

This is also why your validation loss is near zero and your perplexity is 1.0. Perplexity is calculated as e 
textloss
  (e 
0
 =1). The model has found a way to achieve near-zero loss on this flawed objective, which unfortunately doesn't involve learning language.

## The Solution:

To fix this, you need to align the logits and targets correctly. The standard practice is to make the model predict the next token. Modify the forward pass to ignore the final logit (which has no target) and the first token of the target (which was never predicted).

```Python

# model.py

def forward(self, idx, targets=None):
    B, T = idx.shape

    tok_emb = self.token_embedding_table(idx)
    pos_emb = self.position_embedding_table(torch.arange(T, device=DEVICE))
    x = tok_emb + pos_emb
    x = self.blocks(x)
    x = self.ln_f(x)
    logits = self.lm_head(x)

    loss = None
    if targets is not None:
        # Reshape for cross-entropy
        # We need to align the logits with the targets.
        # The logit at time step `t` is a prediction for the token at `t+1`.
        # So, we should compare logits[B, t, :] with targets[B, t].
        # The way your get_dynamic_batch is structured, `targets` is already idx shifted by one.
        B, T, C = logits.shape
        logits_for_loss = logits.view(B * T, C)
        targets_for_loss = targets.view(B * T)
        loss = F.cross_entropy(logits_for_loss, targets_for_loss)

    return logits, loss
```
Your get_dynamic_batch function is already preparing the data correctly by creating x and y where y is x shifted by one token. The original forward pass was the point of error. With this correction, the model will be trained on the proper "next-token prediction" task.

# 2. Tokenizer Choice is Inappropriate
You're using:

```Python
Copy code
TOKENIZER_MODEL_NAME = 'bert-base-uncased'
BERT’s tokenizer:
```
Is not causal.

Doesn't use [PAD], [EOS], etc. in a meaningful generative way.

Not optimal for generation tasks.

## ✅ Fix:
Switch to a causal decoder tokenizer, like GPT-2:

```Python
TOKENIZER_MODEL_NAME = "gpt2"
```
And ensure:

```Python
AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2", use_fast=True)
```
Also set:

```Python
tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token  # Prevents padding issues
```

# 3. No EOS or Story Boundary
You’re not training with a concept of story boundaries, so the model has no idea when to stop or switch topics.

## ✅ Fix:

Add special [BOS], [EOS] tokens during dataset preprocessing.

Use GPT tokenizer with eos_token and include it at end of each story:

```Python
return tokenizer(examples["text"], add_special_tokens=True)
```
