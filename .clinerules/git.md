1. Always stage all the files before you commit any changes.
2. Make sure to read the changes made by using --no-pager to read the chanegs in terminal output.
3. **Most Importantly** - Provide a descriptive yet succinct commit message which encapsulates the essense of changes made w/o being too verbose. 2-3 lines max.
4. **Lastly** - Make sure you get the commit message reviewed by user before commiting the changes.
